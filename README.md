# pandas-challenge

Hello,

This is my final report for the pandas-challenge assignment. The folder contains a jupyter notebook and two folders titled "Analysis" and "Resources." The jupyter notebook contains the requested District Summary, the School Summary, the list of top performing schools, the list of bottom performing schools, the district math and reading scores for students in each grade level, and the requested district scores by school size and type.

The Resources folder includes the csv files used for the analysis.

The Analysis folder contains a written analysis of two conclusions from the data. The assignment states to give two "trends" but the rubric states the written report should contain two "conclusions." I chose to conform my written analysis to the rubric, if you would like an analysis of trends I can provide them on request.

Finally I output one of my summary tables to excel from my jupyter notebook to assist in my analysis.
